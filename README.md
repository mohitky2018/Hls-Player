# HLS player
 I've created a complete HTML file with vanilla JavaScript that includes:  Audio Player Features:  Play/Pause button Quality selection dropdown (Auto, 128k, 256k, 512k) Progress bar with seeking capability Time display showing current time and duration   HLS Implementation:  Uses HLS.js library for handling adaptive streaming Automatic quality switching in "Auto" mode Manual quality selection Error handling and recovery   Styling:  Clean, minimal design Responsive layout Visual feedback on controls    To use this player:  Save the code as an HTML file Make sure your m3u8 files are properly hosted Update the loadSource('master.m3u8') line with the correct path to your master playlist Open the HTML file in a modern browser  The player will automatically attempt to use the best quality based on network conditions when in "Auto" mode, or you can manually select the desired quality.
